# Noise Generators

## Description
This is a personal side project I started around the 20th of october 2025. It is a collection of functions allowing to create some random noises with python and its famous library numpy to accelerate calculations.

## Noises created
For the moment, I have made algoritmhs for : 
- White noise (completly random noise)
- Value noise (I would resume it as randomly coherent white noise)
- Perlin noise (a variant of gradient noise, a much more smoothed value noise)

## Noises I still wanna do
- Fractal noise (basically just various perlin noises stacked up)
- Voronoi noise
- Simplex noise (visually similar to perlin noise, but seems fun)

# Noise Generators

## Description
This is a personal side project I started around the 20th of october 2025. It is a collection of functions allowing to create some random noises with python and its famous library numpy to accelerate calculations (although it still remains incredibely slow when it concerns perlin and fractal noise).

## Noises created
For the moment, I have made algoritmhs for : 
- White noise (completly random noise)
- Value noise (I would resume it as randomly coherent white noise)
- Perlin noise (a variant of gradient noise, a much more smoothed value noise)
- Fractal noise (basically just various perlin noises stacked up)
- Voronoi noise (cellular-like looking noise with many variants)

## Noises I still wanna do
- Simplex noise (visually similar to perlin noise, but seems fun)
